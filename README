## SPIRAL ARM  1.12 ##
######################

Spiral Arm is a collection of shell scripts
for UNIX system monitoring and process control.

The Library currently includes the following:
- ssh-limit.sh
- lock.sh
- setlimit.sh
- stand-alone functions

You need these two files:
install-spiral-arm.sh
spiralarm.tar.gz

To install, become root and run:
bash ./install-spiral-arm.sh

Note:
1 - Root bypasses Spiral Arm.
2 - Use "bash ./scriptnamehere" as root to run the scripts.

Example usage:
# Create the lock. The default is two ssh programs before 
# it triggers kill on the blacklist.
sudo bash /var/opt/spiral-arm/lock.sh &
# So now you can add one ssh program.
# /place/thing-ssh start
# Then add it to the whitelist.
sudo bash /var/opt/spiral-arm/whitelistfunction.sh
# Then lets say you want to drop all the ssh programs.
sudo bash /var/opt/spiral-arm/clearwhitelist.sh
sudo bash /var/opt/spiral-arm/setlimit.sh
# What would you like the ssh limit to be?
# 0
# And there is an alias file to speed up these commands.
